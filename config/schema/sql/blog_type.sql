Over this 300-year period, seven of the 13 mightiest storms smashed Samar. <br /><br />The Philippine Storm Logbook, 1617 to 1876 - in capsule, reads:<br /><br />OCTOBER 10-15, 1617 - Six large ships were reduced to floundering hulks by a mighty tidal-wave-generating sea churner off Marinduque.<br /><br />APRIL 28-MAY 5, 1866 - A rampaging whirlwind smashed the provinces of the Bicol Region, Southern Luzon, Masbate, Panay and Mindoro. In Manila, the barometer plummeted to a record low of 746.62 mm.<br /><br />MAY 4-5, 1870 - A devastating tempest battered Samar and Leyte islands, destroying 400 houses and 15 bridges as another smashing hurricane was dismantling 247 houses in Negros, sinking 13 fishing trawlers and five schooners as it stampeded over the Iloilo seacoasts.<br /><br />JUNE 24, 1871 - A cyclone of unusual fury hit Southern Luzon, Central Luzon and Samar. Big buildings were destroyed and several schooners were sunk or slammed against the shores.<br /><br />OCTOBER 12, 1872 - This one hammered Samar with a sustained ferocity for eight whole hours, crushing houses and drowning agricultural crops with its surging floodwaters before turning with the same great energy to topple towering trees and level down whole towns in southern Luzon.<br /><br />MARCH 4-5, 1874 - The first of this year\'s biggest churners scraped areas in Samar as it passed Panay Island; in one place, Laoang, only two houses remained standing, and as it hit Capiz province, even strong buildings and churches were severely damaged.<br /><br />DECEMBER 25, 1874 - What a terrible Christmas it was! A violent tropical tornado came howling over Misamis, Northern Mindanao and screaming onto Cebu; \"uprooting\" a stone church and mortar buildings; running a huge naval ship destroyer aground; dislodging massive stone docks of Cebu.<br /><br />JANUARY 1, 1875 - A raging tropical cyclone battered down bridges, destroyed roads in Samar completing its New Year\'s Day bash by raking towns on the far northern suburb of Manila.<br /><br />NOVEMBER 25-27, 1876 - A frightful hurricane-generating surging tidal waves rampaging rivers took a heavy toll in agricultural crops and livestock, sweeping away 2,500 houses in the then still sparsely populated areas of Mindanao and the Visayas.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />SOURCE: PAGASA; featured in the article \"Everything You\'ve Always Wanted to Know About Typhoons\".

Try the Seafood Paella and other seafood cuisine such as crabs, prawns, shrimps and shells to complete your seafood fiesta. Do not miss Satti, a southern delicacy that comes in tamo (rice steamed in coconut leaves) and skewers of beef or chicken served in a bowl of Sambal (thick hot & spicy sauce).

It is unique among the Philippine towns because it is the country’s most extensive and only surviving historic city that dates back to the 16th century Spanish colonial period.</p>\r\n            <p>Vigan was an important coastal trading post in the pre-colonial times. Long before the Spanish galleons, Chinese junks sailing from the South China Sea came to Isla de Bigan through the Mestizo River that surrounded the island. On board were sea- faring merchants that came to barter exotic goods from Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax and other mountain products brought down by natives from the Cordilleras. Vigan was also a vital trading post in the Spanish Colonial Period.</p>\r\n            <p>In 1572, Don Juan de Salcedo arrived in Vigan, established Villa Fernandina de Bigan and made it the capital of Ylokos covering most of Northern Luzon. In 1758, the seat of Nueva Segovia was transferred from Lallo, Cagayan to Vigan by a Spanish Royal Decree elevating Vigan into a city named Ciudad Fernandina de Bigan. For more than three centuries, the city was the center of political, religious and cultural activities in the North. Vigan was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List of Sites and Monu- ments on December 2, 1999.</p>\r\n            <p>Today, Vigan is home to proud Bigueños who welcome everyone with warm smiles to the city where traditions blend with the demands of the times.</p>\r\n            <p>Images and sounds of modernity have established their pres- ence in the City, however, they are unable to drown the stillness and elegance of the Past. Vigan City opened itself to change but it has not sacrificed the wealth of its heritage. It is the ability of coping with the Present amidst the bounds set by centuries-old legacy that makes Vigan a living, historic city.</p>\r\n            <h3>Major destinations and cultural activities</h3>\r\n            <ol><li>1.

It was named Batangan due to numerous big logs or batang that abound the Calumpang River. Located 112 kilometers south of Manila, it has a total land area of 28,541 hectares divided into 105 barangays. It was proclaimed a City on July 23, 1969. From the day of its found- ing, the City has transformed from a budding city to a booming metropolis. It is now one of the major centers of commerce and industry south of Manila.</p>\r\n            <p>The City’s international port, a vital link in the nautical highway, serves hundreds of thousands of passenger and tons of volume of domestic and foreign cargo.</p>\r\n            <p>From a mere Php 40 million annual budget in 1988, the City has a current annual budget of Php 1.2 billion.</p>\r\n            <p>Business and technology have drastically altered the City’s land- scape. Batangas City is the site of the biggest oil refineries in Asia, the Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation, JG Summit Petro- chemical Corporation and the three natural gas combined cycle power plants – Sta. Rita, San Lorenzo of First Gas Power Plant Corporation, and Ilijan power plant of Korean Electric Company. This has a total generative capacity of 2,700 megawatts supply- ing 70% of the power requirements of the Luzon grid.</p>\r\n            <p>Fueling the local economy are 47 banking institutions, three public markets, and 3,000 small and medium business establish- ments.</p>\r\n            <p>Although the City has been identified as an industrializing city, the emphasis on agriculture production goes hand in hand with industrialization to realize its growth targets. The City produces 75% of livestock that is supplied to Manila and 25% for local consumption.</p>\r\n            <p>Education is also an equal priority. The City government runs 116 daycare centers and one tertiary school. Environmental protection is another priority program in the City. The passage of the Batangas City Environment Code and the establishment of a Materials Recovery Facility in every barangay to sustain the ecological management of solid wastes is a reiteration of the City’s assertive campaign to make cleaning and waste segregation as a way of life. This is Batangas City today, a fast urbanizing city in harmony with ecological balance.</p>\r\n\r\n            <img src=\"/theme/weatherph/img/tourism/batangasCity2.png\" alt=\"Batangas City\">\r\n\r\n            <h3>Batangas City’s Must Do List</h3>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li>1.

Its main settlement site, Himologan, was a hill-top fortress situated some kilometers south of the present Poblacion.</p>\r\n            <p>When the first Spanish missionaries came in 1622, the people of Cagayan had tributary relation to Kudarat, the Muslim Sultan of Maguindanao empire in Cotabato. However, the people had not embraced Islam and instead, many became Christians. Because of this, Muslim warriors began to attack the settlement. As a de- fense strategy, the priests persuaded the people to transfer from the hilltop to a better location which is the present site of the Saint Augustine Cathedral. The Cagayanons were able to defend themselves from Muslim harassment for almost 250 years.</p>\r\n            <p>In 1738, Spanish dominance was felt in Cagayan. When Misamis gained status of province in 1818, one of its four districts was the Partidos de Cagayan.</p>\r\n            <p>In 1871, the “Partidos” became a town and was made perma- nent capital of Misamis. In 1883, the town became the seat of the Spanish government in Mindanao for the provinces of Misa- mis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Bukidnon, Lanao del Norte.</p>\r\n            <p>The war years in Cagayan were prompted by the presence of the Americans in 1898. After the troubled years, peace finally brought back the economic activities to normal under the guid- ance of Americans. St. Augustine School, the forerunner of the present Xavier University and of Lourdes College, was inaugu- rated in 1928.</p>\r\n            <p>On June 15, 1950, President Elpidio Quirino signed Republic Act No. 521, which granted the status of a chartered city to the municipality of Cagayan de Misamis.</p>\r\n            <h3>Major destinations and cultural festivities</h3>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li>1.

Regada Festival (June 22-24 ) - Cavite City’s party-loving people have successfully combined their love for water and celebrations through the Regada, derived from the Spanish word “regar” which means to water, to sprinkle or to irrigate.

It is naturally gifted with caves, hills, lakes, and coastal areas perfect for nature lovers and trekking enthusiasts.</p>\r\n            <p>Ligao is a decade-old city, once dubbed as a richly-endowed developing town in Albay. It is now considered as the trade cen- ter for the nearby municipalities of Pioduran, Oas, Guinobatan, Polangui and Libon.</p>\r\n            <p>Legend tells that Ligao was coined with the corruption of the word ticau, once an abundant tree whose poisonous leaves were popularly used to catch fish in rivers or creeks. It was also believed that the name came from licau which means to take the long way around or to turn away from the ordinary or usual route. Lastly, most believed that it came from the Tagalog word ‘ligaw’ meaning to court or win a lady’s love. This idea was based on the common knowledge that the place was then known for its beautiful maidens.</p>\r\n            <p>The City envisions to be an internationally competitive trade and educational center of the third district of Albay by year 2018. Its mission is to “turn Ligao City into a community of love, peace, equality, and prosperity; anchored on the following core values: love of God, love of country, love of community, vision- driven, innovativeness, resilience, transparency, culture of excel- lence, and discipline.”</p>\r\n            <p>Aside from the panoramic view of Mayon Volcano, Ligao is gifted with various breathtaking sceneries. One is the becoming more popular Kawa-Kawa Hill Natural Park. It has become a famous ecotourism destination especially for devotees of the Divine Mercy. The Carmelite nuns of the Holy Trinity have put up a monastery and life-sized images of the Station of the Cross that are spread out upward towards the top of the Hill (“without a top”).</p>\r\n            <p>The Hill has become a favorite venue for religious activities during Lenten Season, Christmas, and Three Kings which have become annual traditions for the visitors of Kawa-Kawa.

During the time of Magellan, people were trading vigorousy their goods with the other villages. One Spanish ruler also mentioned in his communication to Spain that Mandawe, the old City’s name, was famous for its artistic carpentry and skilled carpenters.</p>\r\n            <p>As early as 1575, the Philippine pieces of furniture that were mostly hand carved in hardwood by Mandauehanons found their way into the households of prominent citizens in Spain. The Spaniards chose Saint Joseph as the patron saint of this town because they noted that the natives were very hard working.</p>\r\n            <p>Mandaue’s earlier lucrative industries were salt making and fishpond production, which provided income and employment to the people. It also developed its ceramics industries and bam- boo crafts. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, rice and sugar were extensively raised.</p>\r\n            <p>The industrialization of Mandaue progressed when it became a chartered city, from Mandawe to Mandaue, on August 30, 1969 upon the approval of the Republic Act No. 5519. The City has sustained growth and development that begun as early as 1960s when the City adopted measures to industrialize. Then Mayor Demetrio Cortes launched a massive campaign to lure business entrepreneurs to invest in Mandaue. Within ten years, the town which once relied heavily on agriculture developed into a major job opportunity basin and residential area and a minor port of trade and navigation.</p>\r\n            <p>As of 2001, the city has 391 export and import private manufacturing firms and has more than 8,000 major business establish- ments engaged in local and domestic trade, wholesale and retail merchandising and services.</p>\r\n            <p>Today, Mandaue is Cebu’s new economic driver with more than 10,000 business establishments. About 40 percent of Cebu’s export companies are found in Mandaue. The City also contributes at least 75 percent of the country’s total furniture export production. The City was also tagged by the Asian Institute of Management and the Department of Trade and Industry as the “little rich city”, notwithstanding its limited land area.</p>\r\n            <h4>Best time to visit</h4>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li>1.

Nino (“The Traslacion”) – Third Friday and Saturday of January - Perhaps the most religious among Filipinos, Cebuanos come together to venerate the first religious relic brought by Magellan more than 480 years ago.</li>\r\n                <li>3. Mandaue City Fiesta (May 08) – Perhaps considered Mandaue’s biggest event, the Fiesta honors the City’s patron saint, St. Joseph.

The City’s main delicacies are bibingka, tagaktak (made of grind rice and fried in hot oil) and the masareal (made from peanuts and milk). Foreign restaurants are to be found in the uptown area along A.S. Fortuna Street.</li>\r\n                <li>3. Organize a Convention. Hosting the 12th Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) in 2006, Mandaue City and the Cebu provincial government have built the Cebu International Convention Center, a landmark that became one of its kind for convention in the southern Philippines.</li>\r\n                <li>4.
