                <dt>Air Mass</dt>
                <dd>a widespread body of air, the properties of which can be identified as  (a) having been established while that air was situated over a particular region, and (b) undergoing specific modifications while in transit away from the source region.</dd>

                <dt>Anticyclone (e.g. High-Pressure Cell, High Pressure Area)</dt>
                <dd>an area where the atmospheric pressure is high relative to the surroundings.  The wind circulation is clockwise around an anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere, with the wind crossing the isobars at an angle and blowing from higher toward lower pressure.  The wind circulation is counterclockwise around an anticyclone in the Southern Hemisphere, with the wind crossing the isobars at an angle and blowing from higher toward lower pressure.</dd>

                <!--B-->
                <dt>Backing</dt>
                <dd>refers to the shifting of the wind direction of a tropical cyclone observed by the observer from northwest through southwest by way of west (also known as First Wind). It also means that the storm is passing north of the locality (over the northern hemisphere).</dd>

                <dt>Best Track</dt>
                <dd>a subjectively smoothed path, versus a precise and very erratic fix-to-fix path, used to represent tropical cyclone movement, and based on an assessment of all available data.</dd>

                <dt>Binary Interaction</dt>
                <dd>a mutual cyclonic orbit of two tropical cyclones around their centroid.  Lander and Holland (1993) showed that the behavior of most binary tropical cyclones consists of an approach, sudden capture, then a period of steady cyclonic orbit followed by a sudden escape or (less frequently) a merger.</dd>

                <dt>Buys Ballot's Law</dt>
                <dd>this is a law describing the relationship of the horizontal wind direction in the atmosphere to the pressure distribution. "If one stands with his face to the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, lower pressure will always be to the right, and higher pressure to the left."  "In the Southern Hemisphere, if one stands with his face to the wind, lower pressure will always be to the left, and higher pressure to the right."  This law was first formulated in 1857 by the Dutch meteorologist, Buys Ballot, and bears his name. It is also known as the Baric Wind Law.</dd>

                <!--C-->
                <dt>Center</dt>
                <dd>the vertical axis or core of a tropical cyclone. Usually determined by cloud vorticity patterns, wind and/or pressure distribution.</dd>

                <dt>Concentric Eye Wall Cycles</dt>
                <dd>naturally occur in intense tropical cyclones (wind >185 kph or 100 kt).  As tropical cyclone reach this threshold of intensity, they usually -- but not always -- have an eyewall and radius of maximum winds that contracts to a very small size, around 10 to 25 km. At this point, some of the outer rainbands may organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward and robs the inner eyewall of its needed moisture and momentum. During this phase, the tropical cyclone is weakening (i.e., the maximum winds die off a bit and the central pressure goes up).  Eventually, the outer eyewall replaces the inner one completely and the storm can be the same intensity as it was previously or, in some cases, even stronger. A concentric eyewall cycle occured in Hurricane Andrew (1992) before landfall near Miami:  a strong intensity was reached,  an outer eyewall formed,  this contracted in concert with a pronounced weakening of the storm, and as the outer eyewall completely replaced the original one (inner eyewall), the hurricane re-intensified.  Another example can be seen here on Hurricane David's radar composite photo.</dd>

                <dt>Convergence</dt>
                <dd>the contraction of a vector field. In meteorology, the term is used in a broad sense to include the "coming together," or meeting, of winds (air particles) from different directions or areas (horizontally or vertically).  Mathematically, convergence is negative divergence. </dd>

                <dt>Cyclone (or Low-Pressure Area, or simply Low or Depression)</dt>
                <dd>an area within which the pressure is low relative to the surroundings.  An atmospheric "closed circulation" with the winds blowing counterclockwise around cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere, and clockwise around cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere.  The winds cross the isobars at an angle (15 degrees over water and 30 degrees over land), and blow from higher toward lower pressure. </dd>

                <!--D-->
                <dt>Divergence</dt>
                <dd>the expansion, or spreading out, of a vector field.  In meteorology, the term is used in a broad sense to include the "spreading apart," or drawing apart, of winds (air particles) either horizontally or vertically.</dd>

                <dd>position of a body (satellite) in space as a function of time; used for gridding satellite imagery.  Since ephemeris gridding is based solely on the predicted position of the satellite, it is susceptible to errors from vehicle wobble, orbital eccentricity, the oblateness of the Earth, and variation in vehicle speed. </dd>

                <dt>Explosive Deepening</dt>
                <dd>a decrease in the minimum sea-level pressure of a tropical cyclone of 2.5 mb/hr for at least 12 hours or 5 mb/hr for at least six (6) hours (Dunnavan 1981). </dd>

                <dt>Extratropical</dt>
                <dd>a term used to indicate that a cyclone has lost its "tropical" characteristics. The term implies both poleward displacement from the tropics and the conversion of the cyclone's primary energy source from the release of latent heat of condensation to baroclinic processes. It is important to note that cyclones can become extratropical and still maintain winds of typhoon or storm force. </dd>

                <dt>Eye</dt>
                <dd>the central area where the lowest atmospheric pressure of a tropical cyclone can be found. It is more than half surrounded by a wall of intense cloud known as the eye wall.  The eye is where the relatively calm center of a tropical cyclone is located. Sky conditions may be clear or just partly cloudy. </dd>

                <dt>Eye Wall</dt>
                <dd>an organized band of deep cumuliform clouds that immediately surrounds the area of a tropical cyclone.  The eye wall may entirely enclose or partially surround the center.  This is the area where the strongest wind and rain of a tropical cyclone can be found.</dd>

                <dt>Front</dt>
                <dd>the interface, or transition zone, between two air masses of different density.  Since the temperature distribution is the most important "regulator" of atmospheric density, a front usually separates air masses of different temperature.  Fronts are drawn as "lines" separating different air masses on weather maps.  Following are the four (4) types of fronts:   </dd>

                <dt>Cold Front</dt>
                <dd>a front along which colder air replaces warmer air.  Usually accompanied by cumulus-type low clouds and heavy showers, sometimes  thundershowers with violent squalls. </dd>

                <dt>Warm Front</dt>
                <dd>a front along which warmer air replaces colder air. Usually preceded by gradually lowering and thickening stratus-type clouds, a steady type of rain or drizzle, and falling pressure. </dd>

                <dt>Occluded Front</dt>
                <dd>a front resulting when a cold front overtakes a warm front and the warm air is "lifted" off the earth's surface (forced aloft).  Weather and clouds preceding warm fronts.  There is no warm air at the earth's surface, however, as the front passes. </dd>

                <dt>Stationary Front</dt>
                <dd>a front along which one air mass does not replace another air mass. The front is not moving. </dd>

In the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, this is the period from June through November; in the eastern Pacific, June through November 15; and in the central Pacific, the period is from June through October. </dd>

                <!--I-->
                <dt>Intensity</dt>
                <dd>the maximum sustained one (1) minute mean (10 min. in other weather bureaus) surface wind speed, typically within one degree of the center of a tropical cyclone.</dd>

                <dt>Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)</dt>
                <dd>an almost-continuous trough or belt of low pressure around the globe in the equatorial regions. It is where the NE trade winds (of the Northern Hemisphere) and the SE trades (of the Southern Hemisphere) converge, or come together. The ITCZ is usually characterized by strong, ascending air currents, large areas of    overcast skies, and frequent heavy showers and thunderstorms.  It  is also known by many different names:  the Equatorial Trough, the Monsoon Trough, the Equatorial Front, the Intertropical Front, the Equatorial Convergence Zone, etc.</dd>

                <dt>Mei-yu Front</dt>
                <dd>the term "mei-yu" is the Chinese expression for "plum rains."  The mei-yu front is a persistent east-west zone of disturbed weather during spring which is quasi-stationary and stretches from the east China coast, across Taiwan, and eastward into the Pacific south of Japan. </dd>

                <dt>Monsoon</dt>
                <dd>a seasonal wind produced by the alternate heating and cooling of land and sea masses. The monsoon is more common in Asia and there two kinds:</dd>

                <dt>Southwest or Summer Monsoon</dt>
                <dd>this monsoon blows steadily from the SW, from about May to September.  These strong winds are accompanied  by heavy squalls and thunderstorms.  Rainfall is very much heavier - sometimes torrenti≥al - than during the winter monsoon.  As the season advances, rainfall and squalls become less frequent.  In other places, the wind becomes light and unsteady.  In other places, it continues reasonably steady.  Regions affected includes: Most of Asia (particularly South and Southeast Asia) and Bangladesh.  In the Philippines, the summer monsoon becomes stronger whenever a LPA or tropical cyclone is present.</dd>

                <dt>Northeast or Winter Monsoon</dt>
                <dd>blows from the NE, from about November to April.  It is a rather steady wind, frequently attaining a speed of 65 kph (35 mph).  Except for the windward slopes of mountainous or hilly areas, skies are generally clear to partly cloudy during the winter monsoon, and there is relatively little rain (except for the windward slopes of mountains).  However, some low cloudiness and/or light fog (yes, even at low latitudes) may occur along coastal areas.  Regions affected includes: Asia.  In Indonesia, winter monsoon is also known as the Northwest </dd>

                <dt>Monsoon</dt>
                <dd>where the winds shift from NE to NW after crossing the equator.</dd>

                <dt>Monsoon Gyre</dt>
                <dd>a mode of the summer monsoon circulation of the western North Pacific characterized by: 1) a very large nearly circular low-level cyclonic vortex that has an outer-most closed isobar with diameter on the order of 2500 km (1350 nm); 2) a cloud band rimming the 
                    southern through eastern periphery of the vortex/surface low; 3) a relatively long (two week) life span - initially, a subsident regime exists in its core and western and northwestern quadrants 
                    with light winds and scattered low cumulus clouds; later, the area within the outer closed isobar may fill with deep convective cloud and become a monsoon depression or tropical cyclone; and,  4) the large vortex cannot be the result of the expanding wind field of a pre-existing 
                    monsoon depression or tropical cyclone.  Note: a series of small or very small tropical cyclones may emerge from the "head" or leading edge of the peripheral cloud band of a monsoon gyre. (JTWC 1993; Lander 1994a). </dd>

                <dd>a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained 1 or 10-minute mean surface winds of 119 to 239 kph (64 to 129 knots).  West of 180° E longitude they are called typhoons, while east of 180° E longitude are called hurricanes.</dd>

                <dt>Super Typhoon (STY)</dt>
                <dd>a typhoon with maximum sustained 1-minute mean surface winds of 240 kph (130 knots) or greater.</dd>

                <dt>Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA)</dt>
                <dd>a message advising of the possible or probable formation of a tropical cyclone.  It is issued only by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). </dd>

                <dt>Tropical Cyclone Advisory (TCA)</dt>
                <dd>a message issued by responsible forecast activities which provides details of a tropical cyclone location, intensity, size, and movement. </dd>

                <dt>Tropical Disturbance</dt>
                <dd>a discrete system of apparently organized convection, generally 100 to 300 nm (185 to 555 km) in diameter, originating in the tropics or subtropics, having a non-frontal, migratory character and having maintained its identity for 12 to 24 hours.  The system may or may not be associated with a detectable perturbation of the low-level wind or pressure field. It is the basic generic designation which, in successive stages of development, may be classified as a tropical depression, tropical storm, typhoon, or super typhoon. A tropical disturbance is commonly referred as a strong low pressure system.</dd>

                <dt>Tropical Upper-Tropospheric Trough (TUTT)</dt>
                <dd>commonly referred as Upper-level Lows is a dominant climatological system and a daily upper-level synoptic feature of the summer season, over the tropical North Atlantic, North Pacific and South Pacific Oceans (Sadler 1979).  Cold core lows in the TUTT are referred to as cells, or TUTT cells.</dd>

                <dt>Tropical Wave (or Easterly Wave)</dt>
                <dd>a trough or cyclonic curvature maximum in the trade-wind easterlies.  The wave may reach maximum amplitude in the lower middle troposphere, or may be the reflection of an upper-troposhere cold-low or equatorward extension of a middle-latitude trough. </dd>

                <dt>Tropics</dt>
                <dd>the zone of earth's surface which lies between the Tropic of Cancer (approx. 23° 27'N lat.) and the Tropic of Capricorn (approx. 23° 27'S lat.). Same as the Torrid Zone. </dd>

                <dt>Typhoon Season</dt>
                <dd>there is no true typhoon season.  Typhoons in the western Pacific can--and do--occur in every month of the year.  However, 90 percent of the typhoons occur between early June and late December.  A maximum (22.6 percent) of the total occurs in August, and a minimum (0.6 percent) in February. </dd>

                <!--V-->
                <dt>Veering</dt>
                <dd>refers to the shifting of the wind direction of a tropical cyclone observed by the observer  from northeast through southeast by way of east (also known as First Wind).  It also means that the storm is passing south of the locality (in the Northern Hemisphere). </dd>

                <dt>Vortex Fix</dt>
                <dd>the location of the surface and/or flight level center of a tropical cyclone or subtropical cyclone obtained by reconnaissance aircraft penetration. </dd>

                <!--W-->
                <dt>Westerly Wind Burst  (WWB)</dt>
                <dd>a short-duration low-level westerly wind event along and near the equator in the western Pacific Ocean (and sometimes in the Indian Ocean) (Luther et al. 1983).  Typically, a westerly wind burst (WWB) lasts several days and has westerly winds of at least 19 kph (10 kt) (Keen 1988).  Most WWBs occur during the monsoon transition months of April-May, and November-December.  They show some relationship to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon (Luther et al. 1983; Ramage 1986).  Some WWBs are even more energetic, with wind speeds of 59 kph (30 kt) observed during well-developed systems. These intense WWBs are associated with a large cluster of deep-convective clouds along the equator.  An intense WWB is a necessary precursor to the formation of tropical cyclone twins symmetrical with respect to the equator (Keen 1982; Lander 1990). </dd>

                <dt>Wind (and balance of forces)</dt>
                <dd>air in motion relative to the surface of the earth.  Wind is a balance of three forces (if we neglect curvature):  (1) the coriolis (or horizontal deflecting) force, (2) the frictional force, and (3) the pressure force.  This balance results in the wind blowing across the isobars at angles 15° over water (because friction is less) and about 30° over land (where friction is greater), in the direction from higher toward lower pressure. </dd>

                <dt>Wind, First</dt>
                <dd>the initial tropical cyclone winds as observed on the surface from northwest thru west (if the storm will pass north of the locality) or from northeast thru east (if the storm will pass south of the locality).  This means that the tropical cyclone is approaching.  The term is synonymously used as backing or veering. </dd>

                <dt>Wind, Second</dt>
                <dd>the final tropical cyclone winds as observed on the surface from southwest thru south (if the storm just passed north of the locality) or from southeast thru south (if the storm just passed south of the locality).  This means that the tropical cyclone is now leaving or just starting to leave the area.  The term is synonymously used as backing or veering. </dd>
