                Meteomedia provides its services according to the recognised principles of meteorological science and technology. However, because of the large number of factors which influence the weather, the actual meteorological situation cannot be reliably predicted. Rather, the services of Meteomedia represent predictions which are based on experience, with certain degrees of probability. Variations from the actual meteorological situation cannot be avoided.
